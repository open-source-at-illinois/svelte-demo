## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a brilliant frontend framework that uses clever mechanisms like *dom diffing* to update the state of your app

This means you can make reactive and performant user interfaces without needing to reload or navigate your users to new pages.

## What is Tailwind?

CSS is how you style your websites, but it can be challenging to learn and use.

Tailwind is a CSS utility framework that provides commonly used CSS snippets with well named "classes".

This means you can style your website outside of the .css files, and not worry about switching between different files or remembering style rules.
